## Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master's student in **Electronic Engineering** at the **University of Bologna**, currently working on my thesis at **ETH Zurich** in the **Integrated Systems Laboratory (IIS)**.  
My studies and projects span a wide range of topics - from **digital and analog electronics** to **machine learning**, **artificial intelligence**, **computer architecture** and **system reliability**.

I enjoy exploring how hardware and software interact, and Iâ€™m really passionate about **computer hardware**, especially in this new era of **artificial intelligence** and **hardware accelerators**.  
Outside of academia, Iâ€™m an **amateur photographer** and a **video game enthusiast** who loves building PCs and staying up to date with the latest in tech innovation.

Iâ€™m looking forward to opportunities that let me **collaborate with diverse teams**, **travel**, and **keep learning from skilled people** around the world.
